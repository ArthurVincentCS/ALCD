# ALCD
The Active Learning for Cloud Detection (ALCD) software enables to generate reference cloud masks which may be used to validate operational cloud masks, such as those generated by MAJA. The reference cloud masks are generated interactively using an iterative active learning procedure which enables to generate an accurate reference cloud mask in less than two hours. ALCD works on linux systems and relyes on the OTB library. It also requires a GIS software such as QGIS. 

The tool was written by Louis Baetens during a training period at CESBIO, funded by CNES, under supervision of Olivier Hagolle.
